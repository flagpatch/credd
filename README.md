A nice tool software with a text engine, I plan to make the text engine better soon
### This is a very work-in-progress software, do not expect a lot of changes very quickly, as we plan to add more advanced things than what we initially planned. I am working to gather a list of people who know how to program in Scratch (yes I know), please create an issue asking stating you want to be a part of this project. This is entirely free and this is a open-source community project, please detail your commits with all of your changes.
