# credd
<br><br>
A nice tool software with a text engine, I plan to make the text engine better soon
<br>
This is highly WIP and most recent code probably will be unfinished or very light in functionality.

# Working on:
<br>
Credd API! ðŸ‘€ I plan to make some features auto workable with the api, and maybe even allow more cool stuff.
<br>
Decimal to binary converter
<br>
Brute Force tool (might not be able to use WIP api)
<br>
Guilded webhook for recording logs on credd repo
# END (test 3)
